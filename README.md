# 311-analysis

Shiny Dashboard produced by USC Marshall Business School Students for 311 project. Currently working on building key charts (see [issue tracker](https://github.com/datala/311-analysis/issues)) for the deployed version 

## Installing 

You'll need the R packages install before you start. Additionally, you'll need 2016 and 2017 311 Service Request Data in CSV format in the data folder. Go to [data.lacity.org](http://data.lacity.org) to find the 311 data. 

If you want the data to automatically update, you'll need to use the `cron_job.sh` script.
